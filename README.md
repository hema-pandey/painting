 This gallery is not just a collection—it’s a diary in brushstrokes.       Each painting holds a moment: the hush of a temple street, the wild rhythm of a blue horse,       the quiet bloom of hibiscus under a tropical sky.       I paint to preserve emotion, to honor silence, and to tell stories that words cannot.
