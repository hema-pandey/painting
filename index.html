      <h2>🖼️ Painting Gallery</h2>
      <div class="gallery-intro">
  <p>
    Every painting you see here is made by me—by hand, by heart.  
    Some people think I bought them. Some say, “This doesn’t look handmade.”  
    But I’ve painted each one myself, from the bold strokes of the blue horse to the quiet bloom of hibiscus.  
    Even my painting teacher said I have something special.  
    This gallery is not just a showcase—it’s proof of what I feel, what I see, and what I believe I can create.  
    I paint to preserve emotion, to honor silence, and to tell stories that words cannot.
